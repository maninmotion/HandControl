Use case: I am a percussionist wanting to improve my practice routines. I typically practice by utilizing a classic percussion book called ‘Stick Control’ which indicates left or right hands directly below each note. I would like to have a web app which includes concepts from this book with a built-in metronome that visually displays the beat. The display should show the current musical measure as well as the next measure which is slightly opaque compared to the current measure. The visual display of the metronome pulse should line up with the current note and the measures should scroll as the metronome progresses. I would like to be able to adjust the metronome’s bpm as well as the notes to display for each measure (whole, half, eighth, sixteenth notes and eighth and sixteenth note triplets). I would also like to be able to specify the number of times the current measure repeats before advancing to the next measure. This is with the understanding that I can only play one hand (L or R) for each note. I would like for the note progression to be random or structured following patterns found in the first the pages from the book ‘Stick Control’.
