Please make the overall layout more horizontal/landscape focused where the current and next pattern panes are in a separate row with the metronome and pattern controls below. Ideally the pattern panes should be a 65% row with the controls being 35%. Also make the current pattern more prominent than the next pattern pane since the current pattern should be the visual focus for playing exercises. 
Also, make the current and next pattern panes display 2 measures where the next pane displays the measures and notes that will appear in the current pane when the current measure has completed its repeats. In other words, the next pane is a preview of what should appear in the current measure after the repeats have completed.
Also render the notes in the current and next panes to appear more like standard musical notes placed upon the second row of a musical staff. Use this URL for reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_musical_symbols#Rhythmic_values_of_notes_and_rests
I would like to also include the concept of time in relation to the musical notes, defaulting to 4/4 time which equals 4 quarter notes per measure. Other standard divisions of time should be control options including but not limited to: 3/4, 2/4, 6/8 times.
Lastly instead of including a set number of patterns, please distribute the notes with any possible combination of L or R hand notes assuming that a note can only be played by one hand at a time for whatever subdivision is indicated.  With 2 measures per pattern and when applicable, the second measure should be a reversal of the first measure: for example a paradiddle would be RLRRRLRR | LRLLLRLL for eight notes.
