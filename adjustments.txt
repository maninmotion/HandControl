Expand the Patterns concept so that the first measure of each pattern is repeated for 2 measures, then the reversal is repeated for 2 measures, then the Pattern + Reversal is presented. So for example in 8th note notation: RLRLRLRL | RLRLRLRL, LRLRLRLR | LRLRLRLR, RLRLRLRL | LRLRLRLR would each be unique patterns and follow the same ’seq’ and ‘rand’ functionality within the overall pattern flow.

Convert the UI for the ‘Time’ control to a dropdown including the existing time signatures but also add these odd time signatures: 5/4 7/4 9/8. Default to 4/4 but keep the same functionality so that the measures and metronome beats per measure are affected by selecting a different time signature option in the dropdown.

Reorganize the ‘Controls pane’ into 2 horizontal lines where the: Play/stop controls are combined into one control which toggles between Play and Pause. Include the BPM, Volume and Click controls on the top horizontal row. Include the Time, Note Value, Repeats, Mode and Pattern in the bottom horizontal row.
