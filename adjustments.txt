Change the UI so that the ‘next’ pane displays below the current pane and above the metronome & controls pane, so the overall layout should be three rows from top to bottom: Current Pane, Next Pane,  Metronome/Controls Pane. Each pane should stretch to 100% of the window’s width with a small amount of L/R padding.
After the Current Pattern repeats for the specified amount of repeats, the Pattern in the Next Pane should appear in the Current Pane and the Next Pane should then display the upcoming Pattern. Meaning the Next Pane should always display the pattern that will appear in the Current Pane once the specified repeat value has progressed. The Next pane is essentially a queue of the next pattern in the sequence. It is meant to be a preview of what is coming next in the sequence.
The metronome should always emit a sound on each quarter note regardless of the ‘Note value’ control selection when the 1/4 button is selected.
